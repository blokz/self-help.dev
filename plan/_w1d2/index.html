<p>Start Dailies &amp; Overview of a Growth Mindset</p>
<h1>Mind</h1>
Yesterday I asked you to list some Goals and Dreams. We will be using those shortly,.. but first, heres a quick breakdown on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as well as Getting Things Done. What these two systems do, is help you prioritize things and give you a framework for what to do and when, among other benefits. When combined with buddhist values and teachings along with a process for learning.. the skies the limit!
<pre>
--------------------
7 habits -
--------------------
1. Be a Step Ahead / Proactive
2. Begin with the End in Mind
3. Put First Things First
A) Important and Urgent
B) Important and not Urgent
C) Not Important and Urgent
D) Not Important and not Urgent
4. Think Win-Win
5. Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood
6. Synergize
7. Refine / Sharpen the Saw
--------------------
GTD Quick 1 Quick 2
- (two different overviews of how GTD can be done)
--------------------
GOALS ----
Monthly-Horizon 5: Life
Monthly-Horizon 4: Long-term visions
Monthly-Horizon 3: 1-2 year goals
Weekly-Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
Daily-Horizon 1: Current projects
Daily-Ground: Current actions

<p>Process tasks/todos/goals (Current Perspective) --- (WORK or PLAY//Self or Anon)
Pillar 1 : capture/collect (box) (daily)
Pillar 2 : clarify/process (smaller boxes) (tasks)
Pillar 3 : organize (sort box contents) (tags)
Pillar 4 : reflect/plan (Task, Tag, When)
Pillar 5 : engage/do
</pre>
I&#39;m not going to go too deep into GTD or 7 Habits, but if those outlines look interesting to you (along with the Wikipedia pages for both). Checkout the links above to purchase a copy.</p>
<pre>
Personally I have my task list setup as Follows.
* Inbox
* Dailies
* Weeklies
* Monthlies
* Projects & Ideas
</pre>
<h1>Body</h1>
Diet? Not sure what that is, but did you drink more water then yesterday? maybe at a little healthier in either portion size or something like adding fruits and veggies?

<p><em>-_-/</em> Todays yoga moves are brought to you by,.. Adriene! She&#39;s an amazing youtube yoga star, as has a 30 day yoga course, so what better way to add yoga to my personal development plan, then to just drop her right in here.. Each day will have a yoga by Adriene video, click the title to head to her page and click around or what have you. She&#39;s amazing, and worth the follow.</p>
<h1>Spirit</h1>
^_^(Om)
Finding enjoyment in mundane things,.. such as doing dishes or the daily commute. This is easier said then done, simply dance in your mind, imagine playing your favorite dancing or singing game, and goto town in your head, it's quite simple to find enjoyment in mundane activities if we relax our views on the task as as "why me, this sucks" into more of a "i'm glad i am able to do this instead of working in the coal mines or the cotton fields"..,

<p>Today&#39;s Exercise</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend some time to organize your tasks/todo. As you do this, be sure to incorporate your Goals &amp; Dreams from yesterday.</li>
<li>Do 3 &#39;chores&#39; and find enjoyment in them. Maybe play your favorite music and dance while doing said mundane task. * Note Habits Note a few (three to five) habits good &amp; bad in your notes.</li>
</ul>
